Figure 3. Effects of VIP activation on auditory cortical activity.
A. Onset response firing rate of recorded neurons (n = ###) to a white noise stimulus (0 Ð 100 ms post stimulus onset) during laser on and laser off trials. Narrow spiking neurons are plotted in blue, regular spiking neurons are plotted in grey. Red dot indicates population mean. B. Spontaneous firing rate of recorded neurons (n = ###) during laser off and laser on trials. Narrow spiking neurons are plotted in blue, regular spiking neurons are plotted in grey. Red dot indicates population mean. D. Sound modulation index with (blue) and without (grey) VIP activation across cortical layers (n = ##, ##, ##, ##, means/SEM = ). Sound modulation is significantly lower during laser on trials (signrank test p = ). C. Mean sound modulation index during laser on and laser off trials. 


Highlight: VIP modestly increase spont activity (but not evoked) overall, but activating VIP reduces modulation index by sound.

Sound MI laser off = (Response FR laser off Ð Spont FR laser off) / (Response FR laser off + Spont FR laser off);

Sound MI laser on = (Response FR laser on Ð Spont FR laser on) / (Response FR laser on + Spont FR laser on);
