Figure 4. Linearity test. Do effects of running and VIP activation interact?Sound MI sit laser off  = (response sit laser off - spont sit laser off) / (response sit laser off + spont sit laser off)Sound MI run laser off = (response run laser off - spont run laser off) / (response run laser off + spont run laser off)Sound MI sit laser on  = (response sit laser on - spont sit laser on) / (response sit laser on + spont sit laser on)Sound MI run laser on = (response run laser on- spont run laser on) / (response run laser on + spont run laser on)Running Effect = Sound MI run laser off - Sound MI sit laser off Laser Effect = Sound MI sit laser on - Sound MI sit laser offCombined Effect  = Sound MI run laser on - Sound MI sit laser offPredicted combined Effect = Running Effect + Laser Effect
